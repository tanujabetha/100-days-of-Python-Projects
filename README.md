100 Days of Python Projects

Overview
Welcome to my 100 days of coding in Python! Here, I'll be documenting my daily progress and projects as part of this coding challenge. Each day, I'll be working on a small and interesting Python project to enhance my skills and explore new concepts.

Goals
Code in Python for at least an hour every day.
Complete a new project or work on an existing one each day.
Learn and explore different Python libraries, modules, and concepts.
